# DocGen [![Build Status](http://jenkins.styx-sys.com/buildStatus/icon?job=DocGen%2Fmaster)](http://jenkins.styx-sys.com/job/DocGen/job/master/)

A basic PDF generator with templating (EJS) from HTML through Gotenberg

Image `majortom327/docgen` should be used through dockerfile to connect to mongo and gotenberg easily.

You can connect to not dockerized services obviously...
